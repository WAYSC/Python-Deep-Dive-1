# Python Deep Dive I — Language Internals & Advanced Concepts

This repository contains my in-depth study notes and code implementations based on **Python Deep Dive I**, focusing on Python language internals, advanced syntax, and idiomatic design principles.

The goal of this repository is not only to *use* Python, but to *understand how Python works*.


## 🎥 Video Lectures (Bilibili)

🐍 Python language internals, object model, memory semantics, and idiomatic design 

This repository is accompanied by **full lecture recordings**, where I explain the concepts, code, and design decisions step by step.

## 📌 Repository Scope

This project explores topics such as:

- Python variables and object model
- Memory management and reference semantics
- Numeric types and Boolean logic
- Functions, closures, and decorators
- Modules, packages, and import mechanics
- Namespaces and scope resolution
- Idiomatic Python design philosophy

The content is structured progressively, following a **deep-first rather than surface-first** learning approach.

## 📓 About the Code Comments

**Important note about language usage in this repository:**

- All **README files, folder names, and notebook filenames are written in English**.
- **Code comments inside the notebooks are primarily written in Chinese**.

This is an **intentional design choice**.

The Chinese comments reflect my personal learning process while:
- Studying English-language materials
- Re-explaining core concepts in my own words
- Preparing teaching-oriented explanations

The comments focus on:
- *Why* a behavior exists
- *How* Python makes certain design decisions
- Common misunderstandings and edge cases

This approach prioritizes **depth of understanding over presentation polish**.

## 📁 Notebook Naming Convention

To improve discoverability and navigation:

- All Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`) are named **in English**
- Filenames are descriptive and topic-oriented

This allows readers to quickly locate relevant topics, even if they do not read Chinese comments.

## 🎯 Intended Audience

This repository is suitable for:

- Python developers who want to understand *how Python really works*
- Learners transitioning from “syntax-level” to “language-level” thinking
- Engineers preparing for advanced interviews or teaching Python concepts
- Anyone interested in writing more **idiomatic, predictable, and maintainable Python code**

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This repository is **educational in nature**.

- It is not intended as a production-ready library
- Code may prioritize clarity and explanation over brevity
- Some notebooks are exploratory and iterative
